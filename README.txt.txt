TO RUN THE PROGRAM, OPEN main.py IN ANY PYTHON INTERPRETER. VSCODE WORKS. 
THEN SIMPLY RUN THE PROGRAM AND YOU WILL SEE THE GUI POP UP.

NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM IS DEPENDENT ON:
1) GRAPHVIZ LIBRARY
2) PIL LIBRARY

These can be installed by opening the command prompt, and typing in:
pip install graphviz
pip install pillow
pip install pydotplus


AFTER THIS THE CODE SHOULD RUN FLAWLESSLY.
